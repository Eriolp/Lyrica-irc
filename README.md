Lyrica-irc
==========
An IRC Bot

This is a small project written during my downtime, an IRC bot with planned functionality for media control via IRC protocol written in C++.

The options for setting connection, channel, nickname, etc for now, are hardcoded into Lyrica.cpp's initial lines.

This project is mostly used as a learning experience for me, using tools for the first time like:

- Visual Studio and GitHub integration experimentation
- Visual C/C++ 
- WinSocket 2
- Documentation (Doxygen)
- Utilizing IRC protocol specifications from RFC 2812 and RFC 1459
- Version Control, Deployment and Licensing

so it might not adhere to expected standards, but it's still there if someone finds a use for the code.
